# Title Cases

The introduction summarizes the purpose and function of the project, and should
be concise (a brief paragraph or two). This introduction may be the same as the
first paragraph on the project page.

The purpose of this module is to simplify the display of node titles using a
language writing style guide such Associated Press (AP).

Apply a title case from a language style guide to selected content type page
titles. The Title Case module only alters the presentation display of the title
field and does not change the stored title field value.
